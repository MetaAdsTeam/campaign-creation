## 3. About **Campaigns**

As you noticed, **Campaigns** have three rules:
* *Exclusive* - it takes up the entire campaign time. 

* *The periodical* is divided into two types: 

  * *No limit* (the number of impressions of the creative for a certain time)
  * *No more than every* (the number of impressions no more often than for a given time). 

* *Targeted* - works only if a certain number of users are present on the selected scene (you can also select a certain country).
